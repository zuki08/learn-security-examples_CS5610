- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

ID is not sanitized and checked. So when it tries to go search the database for a document with rouge input. It breaks the server as it doesn't find the document, and an error is thrown that is not caught.

The Secure version prevents this by catching the error thrown by Mongooose and handlng it with a log of bad input.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

Add rate limiting.
Add authentication so the the connection is not processed if not authorized.
